# Group 14 - Food n’ Culture

Home is where the family is, but not everyone is lucky enough to have that bond last long.
Food and culture are two important aspects that are linked to one’s ideated identity and can
often be diluted when individuals are exposed to a different culture and cuisine. Food
Culture incorporates our ethnicity and cultural heritage that builds a trust of
communication with others both externally and within our families and communities. It is
the attitudes, beliefs, and bonding over that dining table with someone. Community is built
on the ideas of inclusion and acceptance and for immigrants/international students to be
part of an entirely new community is a hurdle while dealing with homesickness and missing
your home country.

Our idea and application aims to dissolve these situations with the motives of community
inclusion and cultural involvement. The proposed solution includes two categorical user
personas of hosts and guests(immigrants/students) or someone who is away from family
and friends. The hosts can inform the users through a community forum message or
connect directly to the user through a chat message functionality. Hosts are allowed to
select either the party/greet meeting to be paid or unpaid as a way of inclusion. For the
safety of the users and community members, strict community guidelines will be set up
including the KYC and user verification through a government-issued ID. Guests can show
their interest in a particular type of cuisine or dish by raising a request in the application,
once the request is submitted, it will be visible to nearby hosts. Anyone interested can
accept the guest’s request and connect with them.

Additional community involvement can be done through the community forum page where
users will be able to communicate and receive in-app messages from various food service
initiatives. It is important to value the community which supports you and hence a donation
page is supported to respect the values of inclusion and sustenance for the entire
community and hosts.
